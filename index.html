            <img src="assets/images/Me.jpg" class="float-left p-2"> <div class="text-wrap"> Welcome to my Porfolio. My name is Chance Wright and I am originally from Omaha, NE. I am currently 29 years old and living in Denver, CO. I first found out that I was interested in computers at the age of 14 when my parents bought a gateway desktop computer. I found myself taking the computer apart and looking at its internal components. Using primitive search engines from that time I was able to learn about how computers work. After that everything I went to learn was all self taught. I self taught myself basic HTML. Adobe Photoshop was the next program I learned. It allowed me to make my own graphic art from scratch. </div><br>

                I signed up for University of Denvers Full Stack Coding Bootcamp to broaden my programming language experience. I took this class to learn how to self teach myself programming. So far I am becoming proficient in front end web development and hope to learn the back end as well. Thank you for visiting my page and enjoy my portfolio.
